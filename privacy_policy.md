Any data you generate within the Applications (such as recordings or tuning data) is stored only on your device. We do not collect, download, or copy this data.  

### Third-Party Services
Some of our Applications use third-party services, such as:

These services may automatically collect information such as:  
- Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)  
- Approximate location data  
- Usage and interaction data  
- Ad-related information  

This information does not personally identify you, but it may be used for analytics or to serve personalized advertisements.

- [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/features/analytics/)  

You can disable personalized ads through your device settings:
